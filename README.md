## Portfolio website ðŸ’»

After way too much procrastination , I finally put together a portfolio to show off what Iâ€™ve been building and experimenting with. This site features projects using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and a Node/Express backend with MongoDB.
Iâ€™m constantly learning and improving, and this space is for sharing progress, experiments, and small wins.  Check out my projects, and feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate and take on new challenges! ðŸš€
